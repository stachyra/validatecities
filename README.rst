Purpose
-------

This repository contains a Python script, ``validatecities.py``, which was created as a solution to a programming challenge problem originally posed by AlixPartners Consulting.  For the problem statement, see http://www.alixpartners.com/itaa/Careers.aspx, "Problem 3: Fuzz-ography".  The ``README.rst`` file that you are currently viewing is intended to serve solely as a brief top-level introduction for people accessing via Github; for full detail refer to the original project documentation contained in ``README.docx``, and/or optionally also the cover letter, ``AlixPartners Fuzz-ography Cover Letter.rtf``.

External Data Files
-------------------

As delivered to AlixPartners, the solution package originally consisted of eight files, plus an email cover letter, ``AlixPartners Fuzz-ography Cover Letter.rtf``, which was not technically part of the original package but has been added here as a supplementary file, for the sake of completeness.  Six of the original eight files (essentially everything except for ``validatecities.py`` and ``README.docx``) were large data files which were only ever expected to exist under a single version (and moreover were not even under my control in the first place) and were therefore deemed inappropriate to manage using a version control system.  The total package structure, including several external data files which are needed but not actually provided through Github, is summarized in the table below.

Special Notes on Running the Code
---------------------------------

See ``README.docx`` for complete instructions.  Please be aware that the code is not particularly fast; it takes at least a couple of hours to complete.  For this reason, if you wish to review sample/demo output, you are highly recommended to take a shortcut and simply view the pre-generated versions of these files, available for download at https://app.box.com/validatecities.
